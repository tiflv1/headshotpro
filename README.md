# HeadshotPro AI Headshots: Save 85% on Professional Photos, Get Studio-Quality Results in 2 Hours

So you need a professional headshot. Maybe it's for LinkedIn, maybe your company's website, or maybe you're just tired of looking at that selfie you took three years ago.

You could book a photographer. Schedule a session, figure out what to wear, hope you don't blink at the wrong moment, wait a week for edits, and then pay somewhere around $250. Or you could let AI do it instead.

That's basically what HeadshotPro does. You upload some photos, pick your style, and get back a bunch of professional headshots. The whole thing takes about two hours.

## What HeadshotPro Actually Does

HeadshotPro is an AI headshot generator. You give it 10-15 photos of yourself—selfies work fine—and it trains an AI model on your face. Then it generates professional headshots with different backgrounds, lighting, and outfits.

The company's been around since 2023, started by Danny Postma in Holland. They've generated over 17 million headshots for nearly 200,000 people. Fortune 500 companies use it. It's SOC 2 Type 2 certified, which means they take security seriously.

Here's what happens: you upload your photos, tell the system your basic info (height, build, that sort of thing), pick some style preferences, and wait. The AI processes everything and gives you 40 to 200 headshots depending on which package you chose.

Most people get their results in 1-3 hours. The headshots come in high resolution—good enough for printing if you need that.

## The Numbers: What It Costs vs What You Get

Let's talk pricing. Traditional headshot photography runs about $232 on average in the US. That's the median according to HeadshotPro's research across 751 photographers. You usually get 1-3 photos for that price.

Here's what HeadshotPro charges:

| Package | Price | Headshots | Styles | Delivery Time | Best For |
|---------|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|----------|
| Basic | $29 | 40 | 4 backdrop/outfit combos | 3 hours | LinkedIn update, single use |
| Professional | $39 | 100 | 10 backdrop/outfit combos | 2 hours | Multiple platforms, variety needed |
| Executive | $59 | 200 | 20 backdrop/outfit combos | 1 hour | Executives, maximum choice |

All packages include high-resolution downloads, full commercial rights, and their money-back guarantee.

For teams, the pricing gets better with volume:
- 5-9 people: $31 per person (21% off)
- 10-18 people: $27 per person (31% off)
- 50-199 people: $19 per person (51% off)
- 200+ people: $15 per person (62% off)

So if you're getting headshots for your whole company, the math starts looking pretty good compared to hiring a photographer for everyone.

## What People Actually Say About It

The reviews are... surprisingly good? HeadshotPro has a 4.8 out of 5 rating on Trustpilot with over 3,200 reviews. That's better than most AI tools.

People mention a few things consistently. The headshots look realistic. The variety is helpful—you get enough options that you'll find something you like. The process is stupid simple.

One user said they uploaded 15 selfies and got 25 different versions of themselves—"thin, medium build, different hair, different everything." The AI generates variations.

Some complaints too. Occasionally the AI gets creative with anatomy—fingers look weird, eyes don't quite line up. If you use older photos from when you weighed less or had different hair, the results might not match your current look. Makes sense.

The general consensus seems to be: about 30-40% of the generated headshots are really usable, which is still 12-40 good photos from the Basic package.

## How It Compares to Just Using a Photographer

Let's be honest about what you're trading off.

A real photographer can capture your personality better. They can work with specific lighting you need. They can pose you properly. If you're an actor or model who needs very specific expressions, a human photographer probably wins.

But for LinkedIn? Company directory? Website bio? The AI does fine.

The time difference matters. Getting a photographer means: finding one, checking their availability, scheduling a session, actually going somewhere, doing the shoot, waiting for edits, doing a revision round. That's easily 2-3 weeks and several hours of your time.

HeadshotPro is: upload photos while you're eating lunch, pick some options, go back to work, get an email 2 hours later. Done.

The cost difference is massive. $29-59 vs $200-500. If you need headshots for a team of 20 people, you're looking at $540 with HeadshotPro vs $4,000-10,000 with a photographer.

## The Free Version and Money-Back Thing

They have a free AI headshot generator on their site. It's pretty basic—removes your background and adds a pattern. Useful if you just need a quick profile pic for something casual.

The paid packages come with a "profile-worthy guarantee." If you don't get at least one headshot you're happy to use, they refund everything. No questions asked.

That's actually a smart move on their part because it eliminates the risk of trying it. Worst case, you waste 10 minutes uploading photos.

## Team Features That Actually Matter

If you're getting headshots for a company, HeadshotPro has some specific features that make sense.

You can pre-approve backgrounds and outfits. Everyone on your team gets to pick from what you've chosen, so all the headshots match your brand aesthetic. No rogue Hawaiian shirts in the company directory.

They integrate with HR systems through Zapier. You can automatically invite new hires to get their headshots done. The whole thing runs through magic links—no passwords, people just click the link in their email.

There's an admin dashboard where you can see everyone's progress and download all the final headshots from one place.

The company uses this for Slack avatars, email signatures, website team pages, LinkedIn—anywhere you need consistent professional photos across the team.

## How to Get Good Results

The AI is only as good as what you give it. Here's what actually matters:

Upload recent photos. If you've gained weight, changed your hair, or grown a beard since those photos were taken, the AI might generate headshots of past-you.

Give it variety. Different angles, different lighting, different expressions. The AI learns from all of them.

Check your hair in the photos. Apparently this makes a big difference in the results. Several reviews mentioned that good hair in the source photos = better headshots.

Pick the right package. If you need headshots for multiple uses (LinkedIn, company site, speaker bio, email signature), get the Professional or Executive package. More variety means you'll find what you need.

## When This Makes Sense (And When It Doesn't)

**Use HeadshotPro if:**
- You need LinkedIn headshots quickly
- You're updating company photos for a team
- You want variety without multiple photoshoots
- You're on a budget
- You value convenience over perfection
- You need consistent-looking photos across a team

**Use a real photographer if:**
- You're an actor/model needing specific expressions
- You want full creative control
- You need photos that capture a very specific mood
- You have unlimited budget and time
- You're doing fine art portraits

For most people reading this? You probably fall into the first category.

## Privacy and Data Stuff

Since you're uploading photos of yourself, you probably care about this.

HeadshotPro deletes input photos after 7 days. The generated headshots get deleted after 30 days. You can delete everything earlier from your account settings if you want.

They don't sell your photos. You get full commercial rights to the headshots—use them however you want.

The SOC 2 Type 2 certification means independent auditors verified their security practices. That's the same certification requirement for companies handling sensitive data.

## Current Promotions (February 2026)

While coupon codes for HeadshotPro aren't as common as other services, occasional promotional discounts do appear during seasonal events. The standard pricing of $29-59 already represents significant savings compared to traditional photography.

Team packages automatically include substantial volume discounts up to 62% off for larger organizations.

The best "deal" is honestly just their guarantee—if you don't get usable headshots, you don't pay. That's better than a discount code.

## Bottom Line

HeadshotPro does one thing: turns your selfies into professional headshots. It does it quickly, cheaply, and the results are good enough that Fortune 500 companies use it.

Is it perfect? No. You'll get some weird results mixed in. But you'll also get enough good headshots that you'll find what you need.

At $29-59 vs $200-500 for a photographer, and 2 hours vs 2-3 weeks, the tradeoff makes sense for most people. Especially if you're just updating LinkedIn or need matching photos for your team.

The money-back guarantee means there's basically no risk trying it. Upload some photos, see what you get. If it works, great. If not, get your money back.

For most professional headshot needs in 2026, this is probably the move.
